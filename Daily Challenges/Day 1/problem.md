# Day - 1 (18-Sept 2019)
## Problem :
* Take 2D matrix as input

``` 
Example : 
[ 2, 3, 9  ] 
[ 0, 5, 15 ] 
[ 8, 1, 9  ]
```
#### Find the difference between sum of both diagonals.

``` Example : (2+5+9) - (9+5+8)```

* Answer should always be >0 so you need to find whose sum is greater before calculating difference


> Bonus : Allows program to take **(NxN)** Matrix Size as input
