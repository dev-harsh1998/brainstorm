# Day - 2 (19-Sept 2019)

## Problem : TwoSum

- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

      	```
      	Example :

      	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
      	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
      	return [0, 1].
      	```

> `Test Case - 1 : nums = [3,6,8,3,4], target = 11`
> `Test Case - 2 : nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
