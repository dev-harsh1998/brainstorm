# Day - 2

## Problem : TwoSum

- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

```
Example :

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

> `Test Case - 1 : nums = [3,6,8,3,4], target = 11, Expected Output = [0,2]`
>
> `Test Case - 2 : nums = [3,2,4], target = 6, Expected Output = [1,2]`

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
