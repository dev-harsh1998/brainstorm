## Problem : Palindrome Number
<img src="../.assets/easy.png" height="30px">

- Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

> Example 1 :

```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

> Example 2 :

```
Input: -121
Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

> Example 3 :

```
Input: 10
Output: false

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

#### Follow up:

- Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

> Test Cases

```
INPUT = 123         | EXPECTED = 321
INPUT = 1534236469  | EXPECTED = 0
INPUT = -2147483648 | EXPECTED = 0
INPUT = 563847412   | EXPECTED = 214748365
INPUT = 1463847412  | EXPECTED = 0
INPUT = -201        | -102
```
