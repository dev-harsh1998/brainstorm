You are given a forest (it may contain a single tree or more than one tree) with N nodes.

Each node is given an integer value 0 to (N­-1).

You have to find:

===================

The depth of forest at which maximum number of nodes are present.

N can be very large. Aim for an algorithm with a time complexity of O(N).

INPUT FORMAT

=================

An integer T, denoting the number of testcases, followed by 2T lines, as each testcase will contain 2 lines.

First line of each testcase has the value of N.

Second line of each testcase has list of N values where the number at index i is the parent of node i. The parent of root is -1. ( The index has the range [0, N­-1] ).

OUTPUT FORMAT

===============

For each testcase given, output a single line that has the depth of forest at which maximum number of nodes are present. If multiple depths has same number of nodes, then deepest depth should be selected.
